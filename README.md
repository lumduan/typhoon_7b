## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my_ai_project.git`
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or create a Conda environment using `environment.yml`)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for data exploration and model training.
4. Use the scripts in the `src/` directory for data processing, model training, and inference.
5. Refer to the documentation in each file and directory for more information on their usage.

Feel free to modify the project structure and files according to your specific needs.
